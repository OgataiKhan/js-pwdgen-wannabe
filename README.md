# (Joke) Password Generator

This is a joke password generator created as a bootcamp exercise using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose is to practice the use of JavaScript.

The script will ask for your name, surname, and favorite color. It will then output these three user inputs attached together with a random whole number between 10 and 99.

As a bonus I also decided to randomize the background color of the page each time it is visited using a JavaScript function and a loop. If uninterested in this feature refer to the "feat: add simple css" commit.
